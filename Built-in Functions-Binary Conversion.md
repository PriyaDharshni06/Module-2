# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the input into binary using built-in-function.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1.Start

2.Prompt the user to enter a number.

3.Read the input from the user.

4.Convert the input string to an integer.

5.Use the built-in bin() function to convert the integer to a binary string.

6.Print the binary string.

7.End
## ðŸ§¾ Program
``` python
x=int(input())
print(bin(x))
```

## Output
